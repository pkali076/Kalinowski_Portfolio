## Welcome to my Portfolio!

The first project is a Rick and Morty card application where the user can choose some of their favorite characters (and tv episodes). The user can then check the Favorites tab to see what has been saved. Since this application uses localstorage, the cards can be saved when the user refreshes the page.
